# LLM Quiz Time

A simple web-based quiz app that shows a random question on each refresh.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. The page fetches questions from
`questions.json` and displays one randomly.

## Deployment
The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that publishes the contents of
the `main` branch to GitHub Pages. Push changes to `main` and they will be
available at [https://llmquiz.github.io](https://llmquiz.github.io).
